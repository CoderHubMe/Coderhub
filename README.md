CoderHub is an exciting new social media site that allows Software Engineers to not only display a resume, cite work that they have participated in, connect with their GitHub, but also connect with prospective employers and allowing them to see this information. Through these connections users will be able to start networking with organizations that are looking to hire new employees.
